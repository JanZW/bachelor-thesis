@article{nickolas-wolf:quasihypermetric3,
abstract = {Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space and let $\mathcal{M}(X)$ denote the space of all finite signed Borel measures on $X$. Define $I \colon \mathcal{M}(X) \to \R$ by \[ I(\mu) = \int_X \int_X d(x,y) d\mu(x) d\mu(y), \] and set $M(X) = \sup I(\mu)$, where $\mu$ ranges over the collection of signed measures in $\mathcal{M}(X)$ of total mass 1. This paper, with two earlier papers [Peter Nickolas and Reinhard Wolf, Distance geometry in quasihypermetric spaces. I and II], investigates the geometric constant $M(X)$ and its relationship to the metric properties of $X$ and the functional-analytic properties of a certain subspace of $\mathcal{M}(X)$ when equipped with a natural semi-inner product. Specifically, this paper explores links between the properties of $M(X)$ and metric embeddings of $X$, and the properties of $M(X)$ when $X$ is a finite metric space.},

@techreport{hinrichs:johns-ellipsoid,
abstract = {A Banach space X has the average distance property (ADP) if there exists a unique real number r = r(X) such that for each positive integer n and all x 1 ,. .. , xn in the unit sphere of X there is some x in the unit sphere of X such that 1 n n k=1 x k − x = r. A theorem of Gross implies that every finite dimensional normed space has the average distance property. We show that, if X has dimension d, then r(X) ≤ 2 − 1/d. This is optimal and answers a question of Wolf (Arch. Math., 1994). The proof is based on properties of the John ellipsoid of maximal volume contained in the unit ball of X. A rendezvous number of a metric space (M, d) is a real number r with the property that for each positive integer n and x 1 ,. .. , x n ∈ M there exists x ∈ M such that 1 n n k=1 d(x k , x) = r. A remarkable theorem of Gross [Gro] states that any compact connected metric space has a unique rendezvous number. A nice survey of this subject is given in [CMY]. A real Banach space X of dimension at least 2 has the average distance property (ADP) if its unit sphere S(X) has a unique rendezvous number r(X). In the following all Banach spaces are real. Gross' theorem implies that finite dimensional normed spaces have the average distance property. It can be easily seen that in this case r(X) < 2. Since the functional X −→ r(X) is continuous on the Minkowski compactum of normed spaces of fixed dimension d ≥ 2, it follows that r(d) = sup{r(X) : X is a d-dimensional normed space} < 2. It was conjectured in [Wo1] that r(d) = r(l d 1) = 2 − 1/d. This conjecture has been proved only in the case d = 2; see [Wo1]. That r(X) ≤ 2 − 1/d has also been shown if X has a 1-unconditional basis (see [Wo2]), and if X is isometrically},

abstract = {Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space and let $\mathcal{M}(X)$ denote the space of all finite signed Borel measures on $X$. Define $I \colon \mathcal{M}(X) \to \R$ by \[I(\mu) = \int_X \int_X d(x,y) d\mu(x) d\mu(y),\] and set $M(X) = \sup I(\mu)$, where $\mu$ ranges over the collection of signed measures in $\mathcal{M}(X)$ of total mass 1. The metric space $(X, d)$ is quasihypermetric if for all $n \in \N$, all $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n \in \R$ satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i = 0$ and all $x_1, ..., x_n \in X$, one has $\sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j d(x_i, x_j) \leq 0$. Without the quasihypermetric property $M(X)$ is infinite, while with the property a natural semi-inner product structure becomes available on $\mathcal{M}_0(X)$, the subspace of $\mathcal{M}(X)$ of all measures of total mass 0. This paper explores: operators and functionals which provide natural links between the metric structure of $(X, d)$, the semi-inner product space structure of $\mathcal{M}_0(X)$ and the Banach space $C(X)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $X$; conditions equivalent to the quasihypermetric property; the topological properties of $\mathcal{M}_0(X)$ with the topology induced by the semi-inner product, and especially the relation of this topology to the weak-$*$ topology and the measure-norm topology on $\mathcal{M}_0(X)$; and the functional-analytic properties of $\mathcal{M}_0(X)$ as a semi-inner product space, including the question of its completeness. A later paper [Peter Nickolas and Reinhard Wolf, Distance Geometry in Quasihypermetric Spaces. II] will apply the work of this paper to a detailed analysis of the constant $M(X)$.},

@article{farkas:potential-theory,
abstract = {We analyze relations between various forms of energies (reciprocal capacities), the transfinite diameter, various Chebyshev constants and the so-called rendezvous or average number. The latter is originally defined for compact connected metric spaces (X,d) as the (in this case unique) nonnegative real number r with the property that for arbitrary finite point systems {x1,...,xn} in X, there exists some point x in X with the average of the distances d(x,xj) being exactly r. Existence of such a miraculous number has fascinated many people; its normalized version was even named "the magic number" of the metric space. Exploring related notions of general potential theory, as set up, e.g., in the fundamental works of Fuglede and Ohtsuka, we present an alternative, potential theoretic approach to rendezvous numbers.},
